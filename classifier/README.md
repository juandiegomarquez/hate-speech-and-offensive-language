# Classifier
This has been ported to Python 3.
Pickled models have been moved to their own directory.

You can run the classifier on the sample data (a set of Donald Trump's tweets) using the following command: ```python classifier.py```

The progress of the classifier will be output in the shell, followed by each tweet and its predicted category.

You can also run the classifier on any other dataset but simply modifying the inputs in line 8.
